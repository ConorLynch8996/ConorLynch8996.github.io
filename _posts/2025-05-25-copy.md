# arriving in montreal
I am very excited for this week's digital humanities summer institute. 
I will be taking a class on Text encoding fundamentals and their application. 
When I was a senior in high school I took two ancient greek classes and a latin class. 
In one of the greek classes, homeric greek and my latin class I used a tool called Perseus.tufts. 
It is a text encoding project to aid in studying classics. I used it specifically to study The Odyssey and the poetry of Catullus. 
I am excited to learn more about how tools like Perseus are made and how they can be used in more ways.
